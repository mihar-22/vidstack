 * Used to load a low-resolution video to be displayed when the user is hovering or dragging

 * time position. The video will automatically be updated to match, so ensure it's of the same
 * length as the original.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ The following attributes are updated for your styling needs:
 *
 * - `can-play`: Applied when the video is ready for playback.
 * - `error`: Applied when a media error has been encountered.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ The `canplay` and `error` events are re-dispatched by this element for you to listen to if
 * needed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <vds-time-slider>
 *  <vds-slider-video
 *    src="/low-res-video.mp4"
 *  ></vds-slider-video>
 * </vds-time-slider>
