# Quickstart

This section will get you up and running with the library. You'll find specific instructions below
depending on the type of installation method (NPM or CDN), library (HTML, React, etc.), and provider
(Audio, Video, HLS, etc.) you opt to use.

## Browser Support

{% callout type="info" %}
We support at _minimum_ ~92.74% of users tracked on [caniuse](https://caniuse.com).
{% /callout %}

Ensure the following browser support table is suitable for your application. We've built the
library for the modern web; thus, we try to avoid bloated polyfills and outdated environments as
much as possible. At the moment, we only support browsers that fully implement
the [Custom Elements V1](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1).

We've tried to be conservative with these numbers; take this as a lower bound. We likely support a
greater range of browsers and versions, but we won't note it here until we test it; if you're not
sure, best try it yourself and let us know!

## Player Installation

{% steps %}

{% step orientation="vertical" %}

### Select Install Method {% slot="title" %}

{% select_install_method /%}

{% if_install_method is="npm" %}

{% install_npm /%}

{% /if_media_provider %}

{% if_install_method is="cdn" %}

{% install_cdn /%}

{% /if_media_provider %}

{% /step %}

{% step orientation="vertical" %}

### Select JS Library {% slot="title" %}

{% select_js_lib /%}

{% if_js_lib is="html" %}
The `HTML` option refers to our [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
library. Our custom elements can be used anywhere with the simple drop of an import or CDN link as
they're natively supported by browsers. This option is best when writing plain HTML or using a
JS library such as [Angular](https://angularjs.org). Native web components have
[excellent support](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com) in most libraries.
{% /if_js_lib %}

{% if_js_lib is="react" %}
The React integration will provide a seamless experience when working with [React](https://reactjs.org)
and frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
{% /if_js_lib %}

{% /step %}

{% step orientation="vertical" %}

### Select Media Provider {% slot="title" %}

{% select_media_provider /%}

{% if_media_provider is="audio" %}
Embed sound content into documents via the native `audio` element.
{% /if_media_provider %}

{% if_media_provider is="video" %}
Embed video content into documents via the native `video` element.
{% /if_media_provider %}

{% if_media_provider is="hls" %}
Embed video content into documents via the native `video` element. This
provider also enables streaming video using the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol.
[HLS isn't widely supported](https://caniuse.com/?search=hls) yet, but we use the popular
[hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) library to ensure it works anywhere
[Media Source Extensions (MSE) are supported](https://caniuse.com/mediasource), which accounts
for ~96.42% of users tracked on caniuse.
{% /if_media_provider %}

Congratulations, you're done ðŸŽ‰ You might not see anything yet and that's okay because you
haven't designed a UI! You can quickly try showing the [`native controls`](#media-controls) to see
if everything is working.

## TypeScript

We've written the player library with TypeScript, and we distribute all types with the
`@vidstack/player` package. VSCode will detect them by default, but global event types need to
be registered separately; otherwise, the following will happen:

```js
// The event type will default to `Event` instead of `MediaPlayEvent`.
provider.addEventListener('vds-play', (event) => {});
```

Events are a core part of working with the player library, so we highly recommend you resolve
this by adding the following to your TypeScript configuration file:

```json {% title="tsconfig.json" copyHighlight=true highlight="3" %}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@vidstack/player/globals"]
  }
}
```

## Media Controls

By default, we'll remove the controls on the underlying `<audio>` or `<video>` element as we
expect a custom user interface (UI) to be presented. Set the `controls` property on the provider
component if you'd like to display the native UI controls like so:

{% code_snippet name="controls" highlight="html:3-4|react:7-8" /%}

## Media Autoplay

We manually handle autoplay so we can detect when it fails. In addition, the `autoplay` attribute
will take priority over the `preload` attribute so media won't be lazy loaded.

Therefore, ensure you set `autoplay` on the provider component instead of the underlying media
element like so:

{% code_snippet name="autoplay" highlight="html:1|react:5" /%}

## Media Poster

You can declare a second poster in your markup like so:

{% code_snippet name="seo-poster" highlight="html:2|react:7" /%}

The one on the Vidstack provider element is the poster that you expect your users to load and see.
The other on the `<video>` element is shown temporarily as the primary poster loads, or if
JavaScript is disabled by a client or crawler (i.e., search engine).

You can choose to load a low-res image that the user will see while the main poster is loading or
a `124x70` (or greater) sized image explicitly designed to show in search results.

{% callout type="info" %}
See the [Structured Video Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/video)
documentation by Google to learn how to explicitly provide rich information about your videos.
{% /callout %}

## Player Sizing

By default, the browser will use the [intrinsic size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size)
of the loaded media to set the dimensions of the provider. As media loads over the network,
the element will jump from the default `150px` width and `300px` height to the intrinsic media size,
triggering a layout shift which is a [poor user experience indicator](https://web.dev/cls) for
both your users and search engines (i.e., Google).

To avoid a layout shift, we recommend you fill `100%` of your media container and use an aspect
ratio container which holds a fixed ratio (e.g., `16/9`). Ideally the ratio set should match the
ratio of the media content itself (i.e., intrinsic aspect ratio). See our
[`$tag:vds-aspect-ratio`](/docs/player/components/ui/aspect-ratio/index.html) component for how you can
achieve this. Once complete, your media content should now adapt responsively without a layout
shift!

{% callout type="info" %}
You may still see a layout shift if the `$tag:vds-aspect-ratio` component is imported late.
Consider including it in your critical render path (e.g., in your root `App.*` file).

```js title=App.*|copy
import '@vidstack/player/define/vds-aspect-ratio.js';
```
