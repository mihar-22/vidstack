You might be interested in a quick and beautiful look out of the box rather than
designing your own. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vidstackjs?lang=en) or
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7RGU7wvsu9) to be notified when it's ready.

We also have a discussion up on GitHub which showcases our designs for the upcoming
[Vidstack Community Skin](https://github.com/vidstack/player/discussions/702). Feel free
to check it out! It includes designs for audio, video, and live media.
