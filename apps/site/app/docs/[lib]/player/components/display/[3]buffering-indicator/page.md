description: This page showcases how to create a loading indicator for when media has paused due to a lack of data.
---

## Usage

We don't provide a buffering indicator component out of the box because you can easily create one with
some HTML, CSS, and [media attributes](/docs/player/styling/basics#media-attributes).

The `waiting` attribute can be used to show the indicator while media is buffering.
Optionally, the `can-play` attribute could also be used to display the indicator while
media is initially loading.

```css {% copy=true %}
/* Show buffering indicator while media is not ready, or buffering. */
vds-media:not([can-play]) .buffering-icon,
vds-media[waiting] .buffering-icon {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

## Styling

In the following example, we put together a conventional buffering spinner, and position it at the
center of the player:

{% code_preview name="styling" size="medium" css=true copyHighlight=true highlight="html:3-23|react:7-27" /%}
