This section will look at editor plugins and settings that can improve the developer experience
when working with Vidstack.

## TypeScript

We've written the player library with TypeScript, and we distribute all types with the
`vidstack` package. VSCode will detect them by default, but global event types need to
be registered separately; otherwise, the following will happen:

```js
// The event type will default to `Event` instead of `MediaPlayEvent`.
provider.addEventListener('play', (event) => {
  event; // ‚ùå wrong type
});
```

Events are a core part of working with the player library, so we highly recommend you resolve
this by adding the following to your TypeScript configuration file:

```json {% title="tsconfig.json" copyHighlight=true highlight="3" %}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vidstack/globals"]
  }
}
```

## VSCode

VSCode provides support for extending the known HTML entities through
[VSCode Custom Data](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-custom-data). Once set up, it enables
autocomplete suggestions for custom player elements and on-hover information such as
documentation and type data.

### Add Custom HTML Data {% slot="title" %}

{% slot name="description" %}
Add the custom HTML data file path to `html.customData` inside the newly created settings file.
{% /slot %}

```json {% title=".vscode/setting.json" copy=true %}
{
  "html.customData": ["./node_modules/vidstack/vscode.html-data.json"]
}
```
